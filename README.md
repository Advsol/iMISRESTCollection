# iMISRESTCollection
Collection of endpoints and environments used to access the [iMIS](https://www.advsol.com/) RESTful interface.

# Getting started - 
Currently, our collections and endpoints are built and exported via the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) REST client and development tool. You can find and download  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) at https://www.getpostman.com/.

The JSON files included in the [*EndpointCollections*](https://github.com/Advsol/iMISRESTCollection/tree/master/EndpointCollections)  and [*Environments*](https://github.com/Advsol/iMISRESTCollection/tree/master/Environments) folders are meant to be used in tandem, you can find out more on how to import the files from this repository using the following [Postman documentation article](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/). 

We strongly recommend importing and using the **iMIS_SDK.postman_collectionV2_1.json** file with Postman, which is located within the [*EndpointCollections*](https://github.com/Advsol/iMISRESTCollection/tree/master/EndpointCollections) folder.
