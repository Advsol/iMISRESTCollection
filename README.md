# iMISRESTCollection
Collection of endpoints and environments used to access the iMIS RESTful interface

# Getting started
Currently, our collections and endpoints are targeted towards the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) REST client and development tool. You can find and download Postman at https://www.getpostman.com/.

The JSON files included in the *EndpointCollections* and *Environments* folders are meant to be used in tandem, you can find out more on how to import the files from this repository at the following [Postman documentation article](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/data_formats). We strongly recommend importing and using the **iMIS_SDK.postman_collectionV2_1.json** file with Postman, which is located within the *EndpointCollections* folder.
